Scrutor contains several game-tree search implementations in
Objective-C. These can be used to create computer players for a whole
range of games including Chess, Checkers, Go, Reversi/Othello, Connect-4
and Tic-Tac-Toe to mention but a few.

More specifically, this library can be used in all two-player, zero-sum,
perfect information games. The term two-player just means that there
must be two opposing sides. Football is considered two-player, for
example. A zero sum game is one where an advantage for one player is an
equally large disadvantage for the other. Perfect information basically
rules out any game that has an element of chance. This last rule
disqualifies Yatzee, Poker and--most definitely--Jenga.

The framework aims to be easy to use: there's no need for prior
experience with game-tree search or Artificial Intelligence. You don't
actually have to learn anything about game-tree search in order to use
this framework.
